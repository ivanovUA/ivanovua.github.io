## Summary
I'm a DevOps and Linux, Unix system engineer
In my work experience below you'll find over 7 years of Unix and Linux system administration including network administration and DevOps. Last years I'm working as DevOps and provide this culture to companies. Part of being a DevOps required many things of me such as: teamwork, technical writing, project planning and problem-solving. Also, a big part of my time is learning new technologies on a regular basis. When working on a new project, I like to speak with the client, so that I can have a clear understanding of his/her needs and vision of the project.
